## 🛠️ Dependencies

- Python 3.10–3.14 (3.13 recommended, see below)
- PyTorch (with CUDA/ROCm support for GPU acceleration)
- marker-pdf==1.10.2
- transformers==4.57.6
- markdown==3.10.2
- latex2mathml==3.81.0

### ⚠️ Python version

Python 3.13 is recommended.

`marker-pdf` constrains `Pillow<11.0.0`, and Pillow only ships Python 3.14
wheels from 11.3.0 onward. On Python 3.10–3.13 every dependency installs as a
prebuilt wheel. On 3.14, pip has to build Pillow from source instead: this
works, but it is slower and requires a working C toolchain plus the image
library headers Pillow links against. On Debian/Ubuntu install them first:

```bash
sudo apt install libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libtiff-dev libfreetype6-dev libwebp-dev
```

Without these headers the install fails with
`RequiredDependencyException: The headers or library files could not be found for jpeg`.

## 💻 Installation

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.

On Linux/Mac:
```bash
python3.13 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:
```powershell
py -3.13 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install Python dependencies (this installs PyTorch as well):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. GPU acceleration (optional):

PyTorch is installed as a dependency in step 2. On Apple Silicon that wheel
already supports MPS, so no further action is needed. For a specific CUDA or
ROCm build, reinstall PyTorch using the selector at
[pytorch.org/get-started/locally](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
For example, for AMD GPUs with ROCm:
```bash
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.2
```

4. Verify GPU support:
```python
import torch
print(torch.__version__)  # PyTorch version
print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Should return True for NVIDIA
print(torch.backends.mps.is_available())  # Should return True for Apple Silicon
print(torch.version.hip)  # Should print ROCm version for AMD
```

### 🐳 Docker

A CPU-only image can be built from the included `Dockerfile`:

```bash
docker build -t pdf2epub .
```

Run it with your PDFs mounted at `/data` and a model cache volume (marker-pdf
downloads its models on first run):

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)":/data \
  -v pdf2epub-models:/models \
  pdf2epub input.pdf
```

`-it` is required for EPUB generation because metadata is prompted
interactively; with `--skip-epub` it can run non-interactively.

Tagged releases are also published to
`ghcr.io/overcuriousity/pdf2epub` by the Docker workflow.

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage

Convert a single PDF file:
```bash
python main.py input.pdf
```

Convert all PDFs in a directory:
```bash
python main.py input_directory/
```

EPUB generation prompts interactively for metadata (title, author, language,
and so on; press Enter to accept each default). It therefore needs a terminal —
run it non-interactively and it will fail with `EOFError`. Use `--skip-epub` to
produce only markdown without any prompts.

### Advanced Options

```bash
python main.py [input_path] [output_path] [options]

Options:
  --max-pages INT          Maximum number of pages to process
  --start-page INT         Page number to start from
  --ocr-engine ENGINE      marker (default) or unlimited
  --skip-epub              Skip EPUB generation, only create markdown
  --skip-md                Skip markdown generation, use existing markdown files
```

If `input_path` is omitted, all PDFs in `./input/` are processed.

### Examples

Process a specific range of pages:
```bash
python main.py book.pdf --start-page 10 --max-pages 50
```

Convert to markdown only:
```bash
python main.py thesis.pdf --skip-epub
```

### Alternative OCR engine: Unlimited-OCR

For scanned PDFs, `--ocr-engine unlimited` uses Baidu's
[Unlimited-OCR](https://github.com/baidu/Unlimited-OCR) vision-language model
instead of marker. Every page is rendered and parsed by the model, so it is not
worth using on digital PDFs, where marker reads the embedded text directly.

- Requires an NVIDIA GPU with a CUDA build of PyTorch (no CPU or MPS support,
  so it does not work in the CPU Docker image). Peak VRAM is about 7 GB, so an
  8 GB card is tight; close other GPU-heavy apps.
- It is slow through transformers: about 60 s per dense page on an RTX 4060,
  roughly 4x slower than marker. The speed Baidu advertises comes from serving
  the model with vLLM or SGLang on Linux, which is not wired in here.
- Needs extra packages: `pip install addict easydict matplotlib`
- The model (~6.7 GB) is downloaded from HuggingFace on first run. It is
  loaded with `trust_remote_code=True`, which runs Python code from that
  HuggingFace repository.
- Images are cropped from the page render at 200 DPI and saved to `images/`.

```bash
python main.py scanned_book.pdf --ocr-engine unlimited
```
